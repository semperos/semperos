### I'm Daniel (semperos) ðŸ‘‹

I work as an Engineering Manager at [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com).

[Clojure](https://clojure.org) is my primary programming language, been using it since 2010 and making a living with it since 2013.

**ðŸ’» My Open Source Work**

* [Ari](https://github.com/semperos/ari): Array Relational Interactive Programming
* [PiLisp](https://github.com/orgs/pilisp/pilisp-monorepo): An interpreted Lisp inspired by Clojure, implemented in [Dart](https://dart.dev)
* [Metazoa](https://gitlab.com/glossa/metazoa): Tools for viewing, testing, searching, and querying Clojure metadata
* [shortcut-repl](https://github.com/semperos/shortcut-repl): A REPL & CLI for [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com) (Dart)
* [cci](https://github.com/semperos/cci): Minimal CircleCI API CLI Client (Clojure via GraalVM native image)
* [clj-webdriver](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver): (Unmaintained) Clojure API for Selenium-WebDriver

Tiny utilities:

* [csver](https://github.com/semperos/csver): Convert JSON array over STDIN to CSV over STDOUT (Rust)

* [last-stacktrace](https://gitlab.com/semperos/last-stacktrace): Utility to print stacktraces from JSONL logs (Rust)

Learning, experiments, and toys:

* [Gershwin](https://github.com/gershwin/gershwin): Stack-based, concatenative programming language with a Clojure runtime that targets the JVM
* [rankle](https://github.com/semperos/rankle): Experiments with data rank and tables in Clojure, inspired by J and Q
* [kintampo](https://github.com/semperos/kintampo): Hierarchical data processing via file system + ZeroMQ
* [river-crossing-spec](https://github.com/semperos/river-crossing-spec): TLA+ Specification for the ["Wolf, goat, and cabbage" puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem)
* [AsIf](https://gitlab.com/semperos/asif): Language implemented as a Clojure transducer
* [Shackle](https://gitlab.com/semperos/shackle): Stack-based language, implemented in the web browser
* [webdriver-logic](https://github.com/semperos/webdriver-logic): Logic programming API for testing web applications using clj-webdriver

**ðŸ’¾ Technology I Use**

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org) for most of the professional code I've written
- [Goal](https://codeberg.org/anaseto/goal) for day-to-day data analysis, HTTP API interaction, and scripting
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [J](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Guides/GettingStarted) for data analysis
- [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/) built on [Pharo Smalltalk](https://pharo.org/) for moldable development
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for authoring documents of all kinds
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for writing scripts that I can share with folks that might find Clojure unapproachable
- [sops](https://fishshell.com/) for managing secrets locally
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my primary shell
- [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) and [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as terminal emulators
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for multiplexing
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), traditional bindings for Lisp-adjacent work, Vim bindings via [`evil-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) for everything else
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for text editing at the terminal
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most non-Clojure development
- macOS at work
   - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) to move and resize windows
   - [Maccy](https://maccy.app/) for clipboard management
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) for Linux at home
