### I'm Daniel (semperos) ðŸ‘‹

I work as an Engineering Manager at [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com).

[Clojure](https://clojure.org) is my primary programming language, been using it since 2010 and making a living with it since 2013.

**ðŸ¤“ Current passion projects:**

- **Active:** A Clojure-like language called [PiLisp](https://github.com/orgs/pilisp/repositories) implemented in [Dart](https://dart.dev).
- **Tapering:** An interactive CLI for working in [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com) called [shortcut-repl](https://github.com/semperos/shortcut-repl)

**ðŸ’¾ Technology I use (other than Clojure):**

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for authoring documents of all kinds
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for writing scripts that I can share with folks that might find Clojure unapproachable
- [J](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Guides/GettingStarted) for data analysis and solving Advent of Code
- [sops](https://fishshell.com/) for managing secrets locally
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my primary shell
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) as my terminal emulator
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for multiplexing
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), traditional bindings for Lisp-adjacent work, [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) bindings via [`evil-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) for everything else
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most non-Clojure development
- macOS at work
   - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) to move and resize windows
   - [Maccy](https://maccy.app/) for clipboard management
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) Linux at home
